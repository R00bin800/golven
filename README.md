This is code to generate and analyze some data about waves.

This takes into account a wave height and a wave period.
It then finds the Significant wave height and the typical period.

It also finds and visualises the highest and lowest wave, including the sum of them.

The file structure is as follows:
main.py  
pages  
|random generator  
|wave analyzer

This is because the app used to make te site, looks for this file structure in order te make the different pages within the site.  
  

The requirements.txt is used to let the site know which dependencies to download in order to make te program work.
